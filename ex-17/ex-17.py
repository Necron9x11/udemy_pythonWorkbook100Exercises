# Question: Calculate the sum of the values of keys a  and b .
#
#     d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
#
# Expected output:
# 3
#

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

print(d["a"]+d["b"])

# Instructor's Solution:
#
# Exercise for reference:
#
# Calculate the sum of the values of keys a  and b .
#
#     d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
#
# Answer:
#
#     d = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
#     print(d["b"] + d["a"])
#
# Explanation:
#
# It's as easy as that. However, if you want to do the sum of all dictionary values you need to take another approach
# instead of accessing all values one by one. We're going through that approach later on in another exercise.
